## üí¨ Note from the Creator

> Here is my SnowRunner Save Editor that I made after losing progress in my 300 hour save specifically in the Quebec map.  
>  
> All the other save editors I found online weren‚Äôt made for the newer seasons, so I made this editor that supports up to **Season 16**, and it *should* work fine for upcoming Seasons 17, 18, etc.  
>  
> Also no save editor I found could change **game rules**, **game mode** or **time**, so I added those too.  
>  
> This editor **remembers the last save file you used**, so you don‚Äôt need to browse for it every time you launch the app.  
>  
> What this save editor **is not**: good-looking, polished, or professional. It‚Äôs crude, rough, and basic.  
>  
> What it **is**: working (hopefully ü§û).  
>  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This editor has an **auto-backup system** that saves a copy of your original save before making changes, but I still recommend doing your own manual backup just to be safe. I‚Äôm not accountable if you lose progress.  
>  
> üõ°Ô∏è **Important:** Windows Defender or other antivirus software may flag this tool as suspicious or malicious. I don‚Äôt know why ‚Äî maybe because it‚Äôs a small `.exe` built with PyInstaller and I‚Äôm not a verified publisher. You can choose to trust it or not, that‚Äôs up to you.  
>  
> If you don‚Äôt like how it looks, feel free to take the code and redo the visuals ‚Äî that‚Äôs totally fine under the [Custom Non-Commercial License](LICENSE).  
>  
> **Peace out ‚Äì MrBoxik**
