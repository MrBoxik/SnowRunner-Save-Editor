## 💬 Note from the Creator

> Here is my SnowRunner Save Editor that I made after losing progress in my 600-hour save — specifically in the Quebec map.  
>  
> All the other save editors I found online weren’t made for the newer seasons, so I made this editor that supports up to **Season 15**, and it *should* work fine for upcoming Seasons 16, 17, etc.  
>  
> Also — no save editor I found could change **game rules** or **game mode**, so I added those too. I even added time settings... just for fun.
> 
> This editor **remembers the last save file you used**, so you don’t need to browse for it every time you launch the app.
>  
> What this save editor **is not**: good-looking, polished, or professional. It’s crude, rough, and basic.  
>  
> What it **is**: working (hopefully 🤞).  
>  
> ⚠️ Still — **make a backup of your save file** before using it. I’m not accountable if you lose progress.  
>  
> If you don’t like how it looks, feel free to take the code and redo the visuals — that’s totally fine under the [MIT License](LICENSE).  
>  
> **Peace out – MrBoxik**
