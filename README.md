## 💬 Note from the Creator

> Here is my SnowRunner Save Editor that I made after losing progress in my 300 hour save  specifically in the Quebec map.  
>  
> All the other save editors I found online weren’t made for the newer seasons, so I made this editor that supports up to **Season 15**, and it *should* work fine for upcoming Seasons 16, 17, etc.  
>  
> Also — no save editor I found could change **game rules** or **game mode**, so I added those too. I even added time settings... just for fun.
> 
> This editor **remembers the last save file you used**, so you don’t need to browse for it every time you launch the app.
>  
> What this save editor **is not**: good-looking, polished, or professional. It’s crude, rough, and basic.  
>  
> What it **is**: working (hopefully 🤞).  
>  
> ⚠️ This editor has an **auto-backup system** that saves a copy of your original save before making changes — but I still recommend doing your own manual backup just to be safe. I’m not accountable if you lose progress.
>
> 🛡️ **Important:** Windows Defender or other antivirus software may flag this tool as suspicious or malicious. I don’t know why — maybe because it’s a small `.exe` built with PyInstaller and I’m not a verified publisher. You can choose to trust it or not — that’s up to you.
>  
> If you don’t like how it looks, feel free to take the code and redo the visuals — that’s totally fine under the [MIT License](LICENSE).  
>  
> **Peace out – MrBoxik**
